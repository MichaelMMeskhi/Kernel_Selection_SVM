# Meta-Learning approach for automatic kernel selection for support vector machines

Author:

- Michael M.Meskhi

This project is based on this paper by [Shawkat Ali and Kate A. Smith-Miles]().
By collection meta-features about a task at hand (dataset), we generate rules based on collected statistical information and perform automatic kernel selection for our Support Vector Machine.

Meta-features:

- *Mahanlanobis distance (md)*

$md_{rs}^{2}=(x_{r}-x_{s})V^{-1}(x_{r}-x_{s})\prime$
